<a name="4.5.0"></a>

# [4.5.0](https://github.com/hakimio/ngx-ui-tour) (2023-03-13)

### Features
- New `allowUserInitiatedNavigation` config. Enable to keep the tour open while the user navigates to a different page.
  Can cause the tour to get "stuck" if active anchor element is removed from the DOM after the navigation.
  The option is not related to navigation initiated by the UI tour and should not be enabled in most cases.
- New `stepDimensions` config. Use it to customize tour step width, min-width and max-width. Accepts "width" CSS
  property values, ie "250px" or "auto".

  to scroll the anchor element into view.

# [4.3.0](https://github.com/hakimio/ngx-ui-tour) (2023-02-08)

### Features
- New `scrollContainer` config. Can be set to CSS selector or html element reference. Only set this config if you have
  enabled `smoothScroll` and tour step description pops-up before scrolling has finished or doesn't show up at all.
  This should only be the case when scroll container is part of shadow DOM.

<a name="4.1.0"></a>

# [4.1.0](https://github.com/hakimio/ngx-ui-tour) (2023-01-26)

### Features
- New `centerAnchorOnScroll` config. Enable to keep active anchor element centered when possible. "Safari" currently
  does not support this feature.
- New `smoothScroll` config. Activate to use smooth scroll when scrolling to tour anchor element. Animations have to be
  enabled on OS level for it to work. Controlled by "Animate controls and elements inside windows" setting on Windows OS.
- New `disablePageScrolling` config. The config only disables "page-level" scroll and will not disable scroll on
  any deeply nested containers. Implementation is based on Angular CDK "BlockScrollStrategy".

### Fixes
- UI Tour now automatically ends on any navigation which was not started by the tour itself. Before only browser's back
  and forward navigation would cause the tour to end.

- `prevStep` and `nextStep` configs can now be set to step index "zero".

- Steps marked as both `async` and `optional` at the same time will now throw an error since this option combination
